### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer | data engineer who is enthusiastic about distributed systems, event driven architecture and NoSQL databases.

In the last seven months I took a break from my tech career to become a full-time entrepreneur as CEO of the company that my wife started one year prior. After seven months of hard work, two new product launches, a complete reorganization of the company management and a lot of learning, I've decided to go back to my career in tech.
